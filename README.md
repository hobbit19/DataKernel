## What is DataKernel?

DataKernel is a minimalistic wrapper around CoreData stack to ease persistence operations. It is heavily inspired by [SugarRecord][site-sugarrecord] but have no external dependencies (except Cocoa of course) and with some refinements. It is covered with unit tests.

[site-sugarrecord]: https://github.com/pepibumur/SugarRecord

If you have any propositions please file issue.
If you need usage examples - see unit test, it is very straightforward

## Features
- Swift (tested in XCode 9.1)
- Protocols based design
- Fully tested
- Actively supported
- Rich set of operations (but I think something may be missed)
- No iCloud yet (but planned)

## Note

- context.wipe uses NSBatchDeleteRequest on iOS 9 and OSX 10.11, it gives big performance improvements, but can cause problems if you use patterns like wipe all and create new, because it acts directly on persistent store (see Apple WWDC 2015 video or slides)

## Setup

### [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org)

1. Install [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org). You can do it with `gem install cocoapods`
2. Edit your `Podfile` file and add the following line `pod 'DataKernel'` (you have to use use_frameworks!, because this is a Swift pod)
3. Update your pods with the command `pod install`
4. Open the project from the generated workspace (`.xcworkspace` file).

*Note: You can also test the last commits by specifying it directly in the Podfile line*

### [Carthage](https://carthage)
1. Install [Carthage](https://github.com/carthage/carthage) on your computer using `brew install carthage`
3. Edit your `Cartfile` file adding the following line `github "mrdekk/DataKernel"`
4. Update and build frameworks with `carthage update`
5. Add generated frameworks to your app main target following the steps [here](https://github.com/carthage/carthage)
6. Link your target with **CoreData** library *(from Build Phases)*

# How to use

#### Creating your Storage

A storage is a general wrapper around CoreData PersistentStoreCoordination and PersistentStores. The first step you need to get started is to create `CoreDataLocalStorage`.

```swift
let store = StoreRef.Named("test1")
let bundle = NSBundle(forClass: self.classForCoder)
let model = ModelRef.Merged([bundle])
let storage = try! CoreDataLocalStorage(store: store!, model: model!, migration: true)
```

#### Contexts

Storage offer access to uiContext (NSManagedObjectContext on main thread to **GET** data from storage). All modification operations on CoreData entities should be performed with `perform` operation on storage. 

#### Fetching data

```swift
let cars: [Cars] = try! storage.uiContext.fetch(Request<Car>().filtered("mark", equalTo: "Honda"))
let cars: [Cars] = try! storage.uiContext.fetch(Request<Car>())
let cars: [Cars] = try! storage.uiContext.fetch(Request<Car>().sorted("model", ascending: true))

let predicate = NSPredicate(format: "model == %@", "CRZ")
let crz: Car? = try! storage.uiContext.fetch(Request<Car>(predicate: predicate)).first
```

#### Remove/Insert/Update operations

All modification operations should be performed under `perform` operation due to it handles all core data context/threading things internally and you can safely use modification operations under them.

`save` operation perform recursive save with nesting context on core data stack. So, if you change entities that already loaded in uiContext, they will be updated.

Note the first parameter `ephemeral` on `perform` function. If it is true, new context for this operation will be created, and then after save succeeded it will be removed. Creation of contexts in CoreData is rather cheap operations, so don't worry. If you don't need to save data in ephemeral context, just don't call `save`. If you set `ephemeral = false` then a pre-created special save context will be used for all `ephemeral = false` operations.

```swift
do {
  storage.perform(true) { (context, save) throws -> Void in
    // do you unit of work here
    save()
  }
}
catch {
  // There was an error in the operation
}
```

##### Creating a model

You can use the `create()` for initializing and inserting in the context in the same operation:

```swift
do {
  storage.perform(true) { (context, save) throws -> Void in
    let newCar: Car = try! context.create()
    newCar.model = "Honda"
    newCar.mark = "CRZ"
    save()
  }
}
catch {
  // There was an error in the operation
}
```

#### Upsert a model 

Upsert - update or insert first search the entity in storage, and then if it is not found creates it. Just call the `acquire` function.

Important: to get this feature work, you should add model property `pk` and set it to name of the field, that is primary key of this entity. Moreover, this property should be indexed. It is needed to achieve needed level of performance.

```swift
do {
  storage.perform(true) { (context, save) throws -> Void in
    let car: Car = try! context.acquire("CRZ")
  }
}
catch {
  // There was an error in the operation
}
```

##### Delete a model

In a similar way you can use the `remove()` method from the context passing the objects you want to remove from the database:

```swift
do {
  storage.perform(true) { (context, save) throws -> Void in
    let car: Car? = try! context.fetch(Request<Car>.filtered("model", equalTo: "CRZ")).first
    if let car = car {
      try! context.remove([car])
      save()
    }
  }
}
catch {
  // There was an error in the operation
}
```
